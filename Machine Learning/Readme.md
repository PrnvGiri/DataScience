# Machine Learning Idea  
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming. It is broadly categorized into three types:

---

## 1. Supervised Learning  
- **Definition**: The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).  
- **Common Models in Industry**:  

### Regression  
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  

### Classification  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Na√Øve Bayes  
- XGBoost, LightGBM  
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## 2. Unsupervised Learning  
- **Definition**: The model learns patterns from **unlabeled** data.  
- **Common Models in Industry**:  

### Clustering  
- k-Means  
- DBSCAN  
- Hierarchical Clustering  
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)  

### Dimensionality Reduction  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- t-SNE  
- Autoencoders  

### Anomaly Detection  
- Isolation Forest  
- One-Class SVM

## 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)  
- **Definition**: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.  
- **Common Models in Industry**:  
- Q-Learning  
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)  
- Policy Gradient Methods  
- Actor-Critic Methods (A2C, PPO, DDPG)  

These ML models are widely used in **finance, healthcare, e-commerce, robotics, gaming, and recommendation systems.**

Now we are going to divide each types~ into there models and explanations. I will be adding Both theory and hands On practice too. Implementing all the insights we can have, Explaining each steps as well and all possible techniques as the technologies are going to be update.
